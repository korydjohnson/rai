Description: A modified implementation of stepwise regression that greedily searches 
    the space of interactions among features in order to build polynomial regression models.
    Furthermore, the hypothesis tests conducted are valid-post model selection
    due to the use of a revisiting procedure that implements an alpha-investing
    rule. As a result, the set of rejected sequential hypotheses is proven to 
    control the marginal false discover rate. When not searching for polynomials,
    the package provides a statistically valid algorithm
    to run and terminate stepwise regression. For more information, see 
    Johnson, Stine, and Foster (2019) <arXiv:1510.06322>.
