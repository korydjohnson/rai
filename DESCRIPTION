Description: Adapts stepwise regression to adaptively search for polynomials.
    Furthermore, the hypothesis tests conducted are valid post-model selection
    due to the use of a revisiting procedure that implements an alpha-investing
    rule. As a result, th set of rejected sequential hypotheses is proven to 
    control the marginal false discover rate (mFDR).
